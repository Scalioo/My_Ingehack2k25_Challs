### HNP


Let $p$ be a prime and let $d \in \mathbb{F}_p$ be an unknown integer. Recover $d$ given pairs of integers $\{ (t_i, a_i) \}_{i=1}^m$ such that
$$k_i - t_i d - a_i \equiv 0 \pmod p$$
and $|k_i| < B$ for some $B < p$. The $k_i$ are unknown.

This problem can be easily solved given a sufficient number of pairs and small enough $B$.

Consider the lattice generated by the rows of the matrix

$$M = \begin{bmatrix} p & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & p & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\ \vdots &  & \ddots & & & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & p & 0 & 0 \\ t_1 & t_2 & \cdots & t_m & B/p & 0 \\ a_1 & a_2 & \cdots & a_m & 0 & B \end{bmatrix}$$

We'll call the first $m$ rows of this matrix $p$-rows. Notice that if we multiply the second-to-last row by $d$, add the last row to it, and subtract appropriate multiples of the $p$-rows, we get the vector

$$v_k = (k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m, Bd/p, B)$$

which is a short vector since the $k_i$ are small, so can be recovered by solving SVP!
